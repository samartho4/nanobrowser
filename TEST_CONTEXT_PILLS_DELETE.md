# Testing Context Pills Delete Fix

## Quick Test Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Build the extension: `pnpm build` (already done)
2. Load the extension in Chrome
3. Make sure you have some context data in a workspace

### Test Steps

#### Test 1: Delete from List View
1. Open the extension options page (right-click extension icon → Options)
2. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
3. Make sure you're in **List View** (click the "List" button if needed)
4. Click the **X** button on any context pill
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ The pill disappears immediately
   - ✅ No page reload occurs
   - ✅ Other pills remain visible
   - ✅ Token count updates instantly

#### Test 2: Delete from Sunburst View
1. In the Tools tab, switch to **Sunburst View** (click the zoom icon)
2. Click on any segment in the sunburst chart
3. A detail panel should appear on the right
4. Click the **Delete Context** button
5. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ The detail panel closes
   - ✅ The segment disappears from the chart
   - ✅ No page reload occurs
   - ✅ Chart re-renders smoothly

#### Test 3: Multiple Deletions
1. Delete 3-4 context pills in quick succession
2. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Each pill disappears immediately after clicking delete
   - ✅ No lag or freezing
   - ✅ No page reloads
   - ✅ UI remains responsive

#### Test 4: Persistence Check
1. Delete a context pill
2. Refresh the options page (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. Navigate back to the Tools tab
4. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ The deleted pill is still gone
   - ✅ Deletion persisted to storage

#### Test 5: Error Handling (Optional)
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and set throttling to "Offline"
3. Try to delete a context pill
4. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Pill still disappears from UI (optimistic update)
   - ✅ Error is logged in console
   - ⚠️ Note: In current implementation, the pill won't reappear on error (future improvement)

### What to Look For

#### ✅ Good Signs
- Instant UI updates
- Smooth animations
- No page flashing or reloading
- Console shows no errors
- Token counts update correctly

#### ❌ Bad Signs
- Page reloads after deletion
- Delay before pill disappears
- Pills reappear after deletion
- Console errors
- UI freezes or becomes unresponsive

### Debugging

If you see issues, check the browser console for:
```
Failed to delete context: [error message]
```

You can also test the backend directly in the console:
```javascript
// Test deletion
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: 'REMOVE_CONTEXT_ITEM',
  payload: {
    workspaceId: 'test-workspace',
    itemId: 'some-pill-id'
  }
}, (response) => {
  console.log('Delete response:', response);
});
```

### Performance Check

The deletion should be:
- **UI Update**: < 16ms (instant, one frame)
- **Backend Sync**: < 200ms (background operation)
- **Total User-Perceived Time**: < 16ms (feels instant)

### Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- ✅ Chrome 120+
- ✅ Edge 120+
- ⚠️ Other Chromium browsers should work but not tested

## Common Issues

### Issue: Pills reappear after deletion
**Cause**: Backend deletion failed but UI was updated
**Solution**: Check console for errors, verify storage permissions

### Issue: Page still reloads
**Cause**: Old cached version of the extension
**Solution**: 
1. Remove the extension
2. Clear browser cache
3. Reload the extension

### Issue: Delete button doesn't work
**Cause**: Event handler not attached
**Solution**: Check console for React errors, rebuild the extension

## Success Criteria

All tests pass when:
- ✅ No page reloads occur during deletion
- ✅ UI updates are instant (< 16ms)
- ✅ Deletions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Multiple rapid deletions work smoothly
