# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive light theme system for the Shannon Chrome extension, providing users with the ability to switch between dark and light visual themes across all UI components including the side panel, options page, and extension popups.

## Glossary

- **Theme_System**: The centralized theme management system that controls visual appearance across all extension components
- **Side_Panel**: The main chat interface accessible via Chrome's side panel API
- **Options_Page**: The extension settings and configuration interface
- **Theme_Storage**: Chrome extension storage mechanism for persisting user theme preferences
- **Context_Pills**: Interactive UI elements displaying contextual information with theme-aware styling
- **Workspace_UI**: User interface components for workspace management and switching
