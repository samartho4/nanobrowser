# Shannon Deep Agents Requirements
## LangChain Deep Agents + Visual Context Engineering Implementation

## Introduction

This specification implements Shannon Deep Agents architecture based on your comprehensive implementation plan, featuring LangChain's proven Deep Agents patterns: LangGraph Store backend, Context Engineering (WRITE/SELECT/COMPRESS/ISOLATE), TodoList middleware, three-tier memory system (episodic/semantic/procedural), workspace isolation, visual context builder with @-mentions, and ambient monitoring. The system builds upon Shannon's existing polished architecture (HybridAIClient, MessageManager, SidePanel UI, Options tabs) while adding sophisticated agent coordination and user-controlled context management.
