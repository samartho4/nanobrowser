# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Screenshots

Based on the Chrome DevTools console screenshots, the following critical errors were identified:

### 1. Validation Errors: "Expected string, received array"
**Symptom**: Zod validation errors showing type mismatches in the response
**Root Cause**: The model output structure doesn't match the expected schema
**Location**: Multiple agents (BaseAgent, PlannerAgent, NavigatorAgent)

### 2. "Action undefined not exists"
**Symptom**: NavigatorAgent trying to execute an action with undefined name
**Root Cause**: Model returning malformed action objects where the action name is undefined
**Location**: `navigator.ts` - `doMultiAction` method

### 3. "QuotaExceededError: The input is too large"
**Symptom**: Firebase/Gemini API rejecting requests due to prompt size
**Root Cause**: Prompts with full browser state + complex schemas exceeding API limits
**Location**: `firebaseBridge.ts` - prompt construction

### 4. "Failed to parse or validate response"
**Symptom**: Multiple parse/validation failures across agents
**Root Cause**: Model responses not matching expected JSON structure or containing invalid JSON
**Location**: `base.ts` - `invoke` and `validateModelOutput` methods

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Enhanced Schema Description (firebaseBridge.ts)

**Problem**: Full JSON schemas in prompts were too large and causing truncation
**Solution**: Created `createSchemaDescription()` function to generate concise schema descriptions

```typescript
// Instead of including full schema:
// Schema: { "current_state": { "type": "object", "properties": {...} }, ... }

// Now uses concise description:
// The response must have: {"current_state": {...}, "action": [array of action objects]}
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces prompt size significantly
- Clearer instructions for the model
- Avoids JSON truncation issues

### Fix 2: Prompt Size Management (firebaseBridge.ts)

**Problem**: Large prompts causing QuotaExceededError
**Solution**: Added prompt size checking and intelligent truncation

```typescript
const MAX_PROMPT_SIZE = 30000; // Conservative limit
if (totalSize > MAX_PROMPT_SIZE) {
  // Truncate middle, keep beginning and end
  // This preserves context while staying under limits
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents API quota errors
- Maintains important context (start and end of prompt)
- Logs warnings when truncation occurs

### Fix 3: Enhanced Validation Logging (base.ts)

**Problem**: Validation failures were hard to debug
**Solution**: Added detailed logging for parse and validation errors

```typescript
// Now logs:
// - Response content preview
// - Parsed JSON structure
// - Specific Zod validation issues
// - Data that failed validation
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier debugging of validation failures
- Can see exactly what the model returned
- Identifies specific schema mismatches

### Fix 4: Robust Action Handling (navigator.ts)

**Problem**: Malformed action objects causing "Action undefined not exists" errors
**Solution**: Enhanced `fixActions()` and `doMultiAction()` with validation

```typescript
// fixActions now:
// - Filters out null/undefined actions
// - Validates each action has properties
// - Checks for undefined action names
// - Logs detailed debug info

// doMultiAction now:
// - Validates action structure before execution
// - Checks for empty or invalid action objects
// - Handles undefined action names gracefully
// - Continues execution on non-fatal errors
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents crashes from malformed actions
- Better error messages
- More resilient to model output variations
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test with Cloud-Only Mode
Since you're currently in cloud-only testing mode, verify:
- [ ] Prompts stay under size limits
- [ ] Validation errors are properly logged
- [ ] Action parsing handles various response formats
- [ ] Error messages are helpful for debugging

### 2. Monitor Console Output
Watch for these log messages:
- `[FirebaseBridge] Prompt too large` - Indicates truncation
- `[BaseAgent] Validation issues` - Shows specific schema problems
- `[NavigatorAgent] Skipping non-object action` - Filters bad actions
- `[NavigatorAgent] Action has undefined name` - Catches undefined actions

### 3. Check for Remaining Issues
If you still see errors:
1. Check the validation issues in the logs
2. Look at the "Data that failed validation" output
3. Compare model output structure to expected schema
4. Verify action names are valid

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test the extension with these fixes
2. Monitor console for new error patterns
3. Check if actions execute successfully

### If Issues Persist
1. **Schema Mismatch**: The model might need better prompting to match the expected structure
2. **Action Format**: May need to adjust how actions are parsed from model output
3. **Prompt Size**: Might need to reduce browser state detail or use summarization

### Future Improvements
1. Add retry logic for validation failures
2. Implement fallback schemas for common error patterns
3. Add model output repair/correction logic
4. Consider streaming responses to handle large outputs
