# Task 12: Shannon Branding - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed the Shannon branding task, updating the extension name from "Nanobrowser" to "Shannon" throughout the codebase.

## Completed Work

### Subtask 12.1: Design and Create Logo ✅
**Created Shannon Logo Design:**
- Created `chrome-extension/public/shannon-logo.svg` - SVG source file with Maxwell's demon inspired design
- Design features:
  - Central purple gate representing the demon's sorting mechanism
  - Red particles (unsorted/hot) on left, blue particles (sorted/cold) on right
  - Friendly demon character at bottom
  - Purple information flow arrows
  - Subtle binary symbols (01, 10, 11, 00) in corners
  - Color scheme: Deep blues (#1a1a2e), purples (#8b5cf6, #a78bfa), red and blue accents

**Documentation:**
- Created `chrome-extension/public/SHANNON_LOGO_README.md` with:
  - Logo concept explanation
  - Multiple methods for PNG generation (Inkscape, rsvg-convert, ImageMagick, online tools, design software)
  - Instructions for generating icon-128.png and icon-32.png

**Note:** PNG files need to be generated from the SVG using one of the documented methods, as image conversion tools were not available in the environment.
