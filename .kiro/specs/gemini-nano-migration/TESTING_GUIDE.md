# Testing Guide: Hybrid Approach with Navigator Schema

## ‚úÖ Build Complete

The extension has been built with the Hybrid Approach implementation.

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `dist` folder: `/Users/khwahishvaid/Desktop/nanobrowserHybrid/dist`

### Step 2: Open DevTools for Side Panel

**Important:** You need to inspect the side panel page to see the Firebase Bridge logs.

1. In browser, click Extensions icon ‚Üí Shannon
2. The side panel will open
3. **Right-click inside the side panel** ‚Üí **Inspect**
4. DevTools will open showing the side panel's console
5. **Keep this DevTools window visible** during testing

### Step 3: Set Up Gemini API Key (if not already done)

1. In the side panel, click **Settings** or **Options**
2. Find **LLM Providers** section
3. Add your **Gemini API key**
4. Save

### Step 4: Run a Navigation Task

Give Shannon a task that requires navigation with actions. Examples:

**Simple Test:**
```
Go to google.com and search for "pottery"
```

**Medium Test:**
```
Go to github.com/samartho4/nanobrowser and check if the repo is starred
```

**Complex Test:**
```
Go to amazon.com, search for "laptop", click on the first result, and tell me the price
```

### Step 5: Monitor the Console Logs

Watch the **Side Panel DevTools Console** for these key log messages:

#### ‚úÖ **What You Should See:**

**For Navigator Schema (Complex - 20+ properties):**

```
[FirebaseBridge] Received HYBRID_SDK_INVOKE message
[FirebaseBridge] Schema detected - using HYBRID generation approach
[FirebaseBridge] Schema complexity: 25 (threshold: 5)
[FirebaseBridge] High complexity - using plain text directly
[FirebaseBridge] Using PLAIN TEXT method with JSON instructions
[FirebaseBridge] ‚úÖ Plain text method succeeded, length: 847
[FirebaseBridge] ‚úÖ Generation complete, final response length: 847
```

**Key Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Complexity score > 5 (should be ~20-30 for Navigator)
- ‚úÖ "High complexity - using plain text directly"
- ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Plain text method succeeded"
- ‚úÖ No truncation errors
- ‚úÖ Response length > 500 chars (complete JSON)

#### ‚ùå **What You Should NOT See:**

```
[FirebaseBridge] Structured output failed, falling back...
[FirebaseBridge] JSON Truncation
[FirebaseBridge] Malformed JSON
Position 1107 (truncated mid-response)
```

### Step 6: Verify Cache Learning

Run the **same task again** (or a similar navigation task):

**Second Request Should Show:**

```
[FirebaseBridge] Schema complexity: 25 (threshold: 5)
[FirebaseBridge] Using cached method: plaintext
[FirebaseBridge] Using PLAIN TEXT method with JSON instructions
[FirebaseBridge] ‚úÖ Plain text method succeeded
```

**Key Indicator:**
- ‚úÖ "Using cached method: plaintext" (learned from first request!)

### Step 7: Test Simple Schema (Optional)

To verify structured output works for simple schemas, you can:

1. Give a very simple task that doesn't require navigation:
   ```
   Wait 3 seconds
   ```

2. Look for logs:
   ```
   [FirebaseBridge] Schema complexity: 2 (threshold: 5)
   [FirebaseBridge] Low complexity - trying structured output first
   [FirebaseBridge] Using STRUCTURED OUTPUT method
   [FirebaseBridge] ‚úÖ Structured output succeeded
   ```

---

## üìä Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ **PASS** if you see:

1. **Complexity Detection Working**
   - Navigator schema detected as "High complexity" (>5)
   - Simple schemas detected as "Low complexity" (‚â§5)

2. **Correct Method Selection**
   - Navigator uses "PLAIN TEXT method"
   - Simple tasks use "STRUCTURED OUTPUT method" (if tested)

3. **No Truncation**
   - Complete JSON responses (length > 500 chars typically)
   - No "Position XXX" truncation errors
   - No malformed JSON errors

4. **Cache Learning**
   - First request: Decides based on complexity
   - Second request: "Using cached method: plaintext"

5. **Actions Execute**
   - Shannon successfully performs the navigation
   - No "Action undefined" errors
   - Task completes successfully

### ‚ùå **FAIL** if you see:

1. **Truncation Errors**
   ```
   Position 1107
   Incomplete JSON
   ```

2. **Method Failures**
   ```
   Both methods failed
   Could not repair JSON
   ```

3. **Wrong Method Selection**
   - Navigator using "Structured output" (should use plain text)
   - Complexity score too low (<10 for Navigator)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not initialized"

**Solution:**
1. Check if Gemini API key is configured in Options
2. Reload the extension
3. Close and reopen the side panel

### Issue: No logs in console

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're inspecting the **Side Panel** page, not the background page
2. Right-click inside side panel ‚Üí Inspect
3. Check Console tab in DevTools

### Issue: "Schema complexity: 0"

**Possible causes:**
- Schema not being passed correctly
- Build didn't include new code

**Solution:**
1. Rebuild: `pnpm build`
2. Reload extension in chrome://extensions
3. Refresh side panel

### Issue: Still seeing truncation

**Check logs for:**
```
[FirebaseBridge] Structured output failed, falling back to plain text
```

**If fallback succeeds:** ‚úÖ Working as intended (graceful fallback)

**If fallback also fails:** ‚ùå Need to investigate further

## üéØ Quick Test Command

For fastest testing, use this task:

```
Go to example.com and click the "More information" link
```

**Why this is good:**
- Simple website (fast loading)
- Requires navigation (go_to_url)
- Requires action (click_element)
- Tests Navigator schema with 20+ properties

**Expected result:**
- Complexity: ~20-30
- Method: Plain text
- Complete JSON response
- Action executes successfully

---

## üìà Advanced Testing (Optional)

### Test Auto-Learning Over Time

Run these tasks in sequence and watch cache grow:

1. **Task 1:** `Go to google.com`
   - Should decide based on complexity
   - Cache: Empty ‚Üí Adds entry

2. **Task 2:** `Go to github.com`
   - Should use cached method
   - Cache: Uses existing entry

3. **Task 3:** `Search for "AI" on google.com`
   - Should use cached method
   - Cache: Reuses same entry

**Expected logs:**
- First task: "Schema complexity: X (threshold: 5)"
- Subsequent tasks: "Using cached method: plaintext"

### Test Graceful Fallback

To test fallback (hard to trigger naturally):

1. Look for any edge cases where structured output might initially be tried
2. Watch for logs: "Structured output failed, falling back to plain text"
3. Verify: "‚úÖ Plain text method succeeded"

## ‚úÖ When to Mark Todo as Complete

Mark the testing todo as **COMPLETE** when:

1. ‚úÖ You see "High complexity" for Navigator schema
2. ‚úÖ You see "Using PLAIN TEXT method"
3. ‚úÖ No truncation errors occur
4. ‚úÖ Actions execute successfully
5. ‚úÖ Cache learning works (second request uses cached method)

**Then you can confidently say:** 
üéâ **Hybrid Approach is production-ready!**

---

## üí° Tips

- **Keep DevTools open** during entire test session
- **Take screenshots** of console logs for documentation
- **Test multiple times** to verify cache learning
- **Try different task types** (navigation, interaction, extraction)
- **Compare before/after** if you have logs from old version

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is successful:

1. Document successful test results
2. Update HYBRID_IMPLEMENTATION.md with test findings
3. Mark todo #7 as complete
4. Celebrate! üéâ
5. Prepare for memory layer integration

Good luck with testing! üß™
