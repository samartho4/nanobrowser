## 🎉 Expected Results

### For Simple Pages:
- ✅ Uses Gemini Nano (fast, on-device)
- ✅ No network calls
- ✅ Private

### For Complex Pages:
- ✅ Nano tries first
- ✅ Falls back to cloud (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- ✅ Uses your Firebase config
- ✅ Works reliably!

---

## 🐛 If You See Errors

### "API key not configured"
- Make sure you saved the API key in Options
- Reload the extension

### "Firebase initialization failed"
- Check console for specific error
- Verify API key is correct
- Make sure Firebase AI Logic is enabled in Firebase Console

### Still seeing "Input too large"
- This is expected for very complex pages
- Cloud fallback should handle it now
- If cloud also fails, the page might be too large even for cloud

## 📊 What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Dummy Firebase config | ✅ Real Firebase project |
| ❌ Cloud fallback fails | ✅ Cloud fallback works |
| ❌ Complex pages fail | ✅ Complex pages work |
| ⚠️ Nano only | ✅ Hybrid (Nano + Cloud) |

---

## 🎓 Summary

You now have a **hybrid AI system**:
1. **Gemini Nano** for simple, fast, private inference
2. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (cloud) for complex pages
3. **Automatic fallback** when Nano can't handle it

This gives you the best of both worlds! 🚀
