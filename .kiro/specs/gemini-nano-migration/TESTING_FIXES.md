# Testing the Error Fixes

## What Was Fixed

We've applied fixes for the following errors you were seeing:

1. ✅ **"Expected string, received array"** - Enhanced validation with better logging
2. ✅ **"Action undefined not exists"** - Added validation to filter out malformed actions
3. ✅ **"QuotaExceededError: The input is too large"** - Added prompt size management and truncation
4. ✅ **"Failed to parse or validate response"** - Enhanced error logging and handling

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reload the Extension

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your Shannon extension
3. Click the **Reload** button (circular arrow icon)
4. Verify the extension reloaded without errors

### Step 2: Open DevTools Console

1. Right-click on the extension icon → **Inspect popup** (or open side panel)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Keep this open to monitor logs

### Step 3: Try a Simple Task

Start with a simple task to test the fixes:

```
Task: "Search Google for 'weather today'"
```

### Step 4: Monitor Console Output

Look for these new log messages that indicate the fixes are working:

#### Good Signs ✅

```
[FirebaseBridge] Using prompt-based JSON generation
[FirebaseBridge] Valid JSON response, length: XXXX
[BaseAgent] Successfully validated model output
[NavigatorAgent] Executing actions: [...]
[NavigatorAgent] Executing action 1/1: search_google
```

#### Warning Signs ⚠️ (Not Fatal)

```
[FirebaseBridge] Prompt too large (XXXXX chars), truncating to 30000
[NavigatorAgent] Skipping non-object action: ...
```

These warnings mean the fixes are working - they're catching and handling issues gracefully.

#### Error Signs ❌ (Need Investigation)

```
[BaseAgent] Validation issues: [...]
[NavigatorAgent] Action has undefined name: ...
[FirebaseBridge] Invalid JSON in response: ...
```

If you see these, check the detailed logs that follow them.

### Step 5: Check for Specific Improvements

#### Test 1: Action Execution
- **Before**: "Action undefined not exists" errors
- **After**: Actions should execute or be filtered out with clear logs

#### Test 2: Large Prompts
- **Before**: QuotaExceededError crashes
- **After**: Prompts automatically truncated with warning message

#### Test 3: Validation Errors
- **Before**: Cryptic "Could not validate model output"
- **After**: Detailed logs showing what failed and why

## What to Look For

### Console Logs

The fixes add extensive logging. You should see:

1. **Prompt Size Checks**
   ```
   [FirebaseBridge] Final response length: XXXX
   ```

2. **Action Validation**
   ```
   [NavigatorAgent] fixActions input: [...]
   [NavigatorAgent] fixActions output: [...]
   ```

3. **Validation Details**
   ```
   [BaseAgent] Parsed JSON structure: {...}
   [BaseAgent] Successfully validated model output
   ```

### Expected Behavior

#### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
1. Task starts
2. Planner runs (if enabled)
3. Navigator executes actions
4. Actions complete successfully
5. Task finishes

#### Scenario 2: Malformed Action (Now Handled)
1. Model returns action with undefined name
2. Log: `[NavigatorAgent] Action has undefined name`
3. Action is skipped
4. Execution continues with next action

#### Scenario 3: Large Prompt (Now Handled)
1. Prompt exceeds 30,000 characters
2. Log: `[FirebaseBridge] Prompt too large, truncating`
3. Prompt is truncated intelligently
4. Request succeeds

#### Scenario 4: Validation Error (Better Debugging)
1. Model returns unexpected structure
2. Log: `[BaseAgent] Validation issues: [...]`
3. Log: `[BaseAgent] Data that failed validation: {...}`
4. You can see exactly what went wrong

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Still seeing "Action undefined not exists"

**Check**:
1. Look for `[NavigatorAgent] Action has undefined name` in logs
2. Check the action structure in `fixActions input` log
3. Verify the model is returning valid action objects

**Solution**: The action should now be filtered out. If it's still causing errors, the model might be returning a completely unexpected format.

### Issue: Still seeing QuotaExceededError

**Check**:
1. Look for `[FirebaseBridge] Prompt too large` warning
2. Check the total size in the warning message
3. Verify truncation is happening

**Solution**: If truncation isn't working, the prompt might be even larger than expected. May need to reduce browser state detail.

### Issue: Validation still failing

**Check**:
1. Look at `[BaseAgent] Validation issues` in console
2. Check `[BaseAgent] Data that failed validation`
3. Compare the structure to what's expected

**Solution**: The model might need better prompting or the schema might need adjustment.

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Detailed Logging

The fixes already add extensive logging, but you can see even more by:

1. Opening the service worker console:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find Shannon extension
   - Click "service worker" link
   - This shows background script logs

2. Check both consoles:
   - Side panel console (for Firebase bridge)
   - Service worker console (for agents)

### Capture Error Details

If you still see errors:

1. **Copy the full error stack trace**
2. **Copy the logs before the error** (especially validation issues)
3. **Note which action was being executed**
4. **Check if the error is consistent** (happens every time or randomly)

### Test Different Scenarios

Try these tasks to test different code paths:

1. **Simple search**: "Search Google for cats"
2. **Navigation**: "Go to example.com"
3. **Multi-step**: "Search for weather and click the first result"
4. **Complex**: "Find the latest news about AI"

## Success Criteria

The fixes are working if:

- ✅ No more "Action undefined not exists" errors (or they're filtered out gracefully)
- ✅ No more QuotaExceededError crashes
- ✅ Validation errors show detailed information
- ✅ Tasks complete or fail with clear error messages
- ✅ Console logs show what's happening at each step

## Next Steps

### If Fixes Work
1. Test more complex tasks
2. Monitor for any new error patterns
3. Consider re-enabling Nano (remove cloud-only mode)

### If Issues Persist
1. Share the console logs (especially validation issues)
2. Note which specific error is still occurring
3. Check if it's a new error or the same one

### Future Improvements
Based on testing results, we might need to:
1. Adjust schema structure
2. Improve model prompting
3. Add more error recovery logic
4. Implement retry mechanisms
