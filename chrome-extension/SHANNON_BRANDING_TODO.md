# Shannon Branding - Remaining Tasks

## Completed
- ✅ Created Shannon logo SVG design (shannon-logo.svg)
- ✅ Updated main package.json name and description
- ✅ Updated manifest.js with "Shannon" name
- ✅ Updated main README.md with Shannon branding
- ✅ Updated README-es.md (Spanish) with Shannon branding

## Localized READMEs - Manual Update Needed
The following localized README files contain "Nanobrowser" references that should be updated to "Shannon":

### README-tr.md (Turkish)
- Update all "Nanobrowser" references to "Shannon"
- Update description to mention Gemini Nano and Firebase AI
- Update installation instructions

### README-zh-Hant.md (Traditional Chinese)
- Update all "Nanobrowser" references to "Shannon"  
- Update description to mention Gemini Nano and Firebase AI
- Update installation instructions

## PNG Icon Generation
The SVG logo has been created at `chrome-extension/public/shannon-logo.svg`.

To generate the PNG files:
1. Install a conversion tool (see SHANNON_LOGO_README.md)
2. Generate icon-128.png and icon-32.png from the SVG
3. Replace the existing PNG files in chrome-extension/public/

## UI Components
No UI components with hardcoded "Nanobrowser" text were found in the codebase.
The extension name is pulled from the manifest.js file, which already says "Shannon".

## Notes
- The repository URLs still point to nanobrowser/nanobrowser (intentional for now)
- Social media links still reference @nanobrowser_ai (can be updated when new accounts are created)
- The extension will display "Shannon" in Chrome once the manifest changes are loaded
