## ⏱️ Timing Reference

### If test takes this long, it means:

```
< 100ms
└─ Validation only (good speed)

100-200ms
└─ Base64 encoding or small file

500-1000ms
└─ LOCAL mode (Gemini Nano on device)
└─ Fast response ✓

1000-3000ms
└─ CLOUD mode (Firebase on server)
└─ Normal speed ✓

3000-5000ms
└─ CLOUD mode with network latency
└─ Still OK

> 5000ms
└─ Something slow
└─ Check network or file size
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Small Files for Fast Tests
```
Fast test (< 1 second total):
└─ Use image < 500KB
└─ Tests complete quickly
└─ Good for verifying setup
```

### Tip 2: Compare LOCAL vs CLOUD
```
To see LOCAL mode (device):
└─ Look for: 🖥️ LOCAL
└─ Timing: 500-2000ms
└─ Device-local processing

To see CLOUD mode (server):
└─ Look for: ☁️ CLOUD
└─ Timing: 1000-5000ms
└─ Server processing
```

### Tip 3: Check Test History
```
Test History at bottom shows:
├─ Previous 5 test results
├─ Mode used (LOCAL/CLOUD)
├─ Response length
├─ Processing time
└─ Success/error status
```

### Tip 4: Customize Prompt
```
Default: "Analyze this file"
But you can change it:
└─ Edit textarea before clicking test
└─ "What do you see in this image?"
└─ "Transcribe this audio"
└─ Any custom prompt works
```
