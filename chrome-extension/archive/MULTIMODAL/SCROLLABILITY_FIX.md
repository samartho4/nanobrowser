# ‚úÖ Scrollability Fix Applied

## The Issue
MultimodalTest component was not scrollable because the outer wrapper used `min-h-screen` which prevents vertical scrolling within the side panel.

## The Solution
Changed the wrapper div from:
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-slate-100 p-6">
```

To:
```tsx
<div className="h-full overflow-y-auto bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 to-slate-100 p-6">
```

Also added padding-bottom to inner container for better spacing at the bottom.

## What Changed
| Property | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Height | `min-h-screen` | `h-full` |
| Overflow | None (implicit hidden) | `overflow-y-auto` |
| Scrolling | ‚ùå Not scrollable | ‚úÖ Fully scrollable |
