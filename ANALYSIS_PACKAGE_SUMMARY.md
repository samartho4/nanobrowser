## 🚀 Presentation Structure for Judges

### 5-Minute Overview
1. **Problem**: "70% of tokens are wasted on repeating system prompts"
2. **Root Cause**: "Current step-scoped sessions create new sessions per step"
3. **Solution**: "Task-scoped sessions reuse context across steps"
4. **Impact**: "70% token reduction, 30% cost savings, faster execution"
5. **Confidence**: "4-week implementation with backward compatibility"

### 20-Minute Deep Dive
1. **Chrome Prompt API Analysis** (3 min)
   - 5 session management patterns reviewed
   - Best practices identified (initial prompts, cloning, persistence, quota, cleanup)

2. **Current Architecture Walkthrough** (5 min)
   - 7 key files examined (HybridAIClient, GeminiNano, Executor, BaseAgent, MessageManager, FirebaseBridge, AgentStepHistory)
   - Current step-scoped pattern explained
   - Problem: redundant system prompt transmission

3. **Solution Design** (7 min)
   - Task-scoped hybrid sessions architecture
   - Abstraction layer (HybridSession interface)
   - NanoSession (native Chrome) vs. CloudSession (Firebase reconstructed)
   - How it solves: tokens, context, fallover

4. **Implementation Plan** (3 min)
   - 4 phases over 4 weeks
   - Specific file modifications with line counts
   - Risk mitigation and success metrics
   - Go/no-go gates between phases

5. **Q&A** (2 min)

### Questions You Might Get

**Q: Why not just increase Nano's session lifetime?**  
A: Nano sessions already reuse within a model instance. Problem is new model instances may be created per step. Our solution uses task-scoped sessions to prevent that.

**Q: How does this work with Firebase Cloud if it's stateless?**  
A: CloudSession reconstructs context by caching system prompt and schema at init time, then adding only incremental state per invoke. It presents same interface as NanoSession.

**Q: What if Nano session is destroyed mid-task?**  
A: SessionManager catches the error and transparently switches to CloudSession with same cached context. User transparent.

**Q: Is this backward compatible?**  
A: Yes. Old `aiClient.invoke()` continues to work. New session API is opt-in. Gradual migration possible.

**Q: How does this help your episodic memory layer mentioned in your schema optimization report?**  
A: Task-scoped sessions provide natural checkpoints for saving/loading AI state. Session snapshots can be replayed as initialPrompts to resume context later.
