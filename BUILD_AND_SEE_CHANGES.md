# üö® Why You Can't See Changes Yet

## The Issue

The Context Pills Sunburst visualization was implemented, but you can't see it because:

1. ‚ùå **No Gmail data synced yet** - The sunburst needs data to display
2. ‚ùå **Extension not reloaded** - Chrome is still running the old code
3. ‚ùå **Nivo library needs to be properly installed**

## Quick Fix to See Changes NOW

### Option 1: See the Memory Browser (Already Working!)

The Memory Browser in the Options page ALREADY shows your Gmail data in boxes. This is working right now!

**Steps**:
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Find your extension
4. Click "Options" or the extension icon
5. Navigate to a workspace
6. **You'll see the 3-tier memory boxes** (Episodic/Semantic/Procedural)

This is the REAL data you showed me in screenshots!

### Option 2: Make Context Pills Work

The Context Pills (in side panel) need data first:

**Step 1: Sync Gmail Data**
```javascript
// Open DevTools Console (F12)
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: 'SYNC_GMAIL_MEMORY',
  payload: {
    workspaceId: 'work-workspace', // or your workspace ID
    maxMessages: 10,
    daysBack: 7,
    forceRefresh: true
  }
}, (response) => {
  console.log('Sync started:', response);
});
```

**Step 2: Check Context Pills**
```javascript
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: 'GET_CONTEXT_PILLS',
  payload: { workspaceId: 'work-workspace' }
}, (response) => {
  console.log('Pills:', response.pills);
  // If pills.length > 0, sunburst will show!
});
```

**Step 3: Reload Extension**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Click the reload icon on your extension
3. Open side panel
4. You should see the sunburst!

## What I Actually Built

### 1. Context Pills Sunburst (Side Panel)
- **Location**: Side panel chat interface
- **Purpose**: Show active context for current conversation
- **Data Source**: ContextManager (needs to be populated first)

### 2. Memory Browser (Options Page) - ALREADY WORKING!
- **Location**: Options page ‚Üí Workspace details
- **Purpose**: Show all Gmail data in 3-tier memory
- **Data Source**: Memory stats from Gmail sync
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **THIS IS WHAT YOU SAW IN SCREENSHOTS**

## The Confusion

You showed me screenshots of the **Memory Browser** (Options page), not the **Context Pills** (Side panel). These are TWO DIFFERENT UIs:

| Feature | Location | Purpose | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Memory Browser** | Options Page | View all Gmail memory | ‚úÖ Working |
| **Context Pills** | Side Panel | Active chat context | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs data |

## To See Changes Immediately
