# Quick Reference: PageCapture Feature Breakdown

## What Was Built

A complete intelligent page capture and voice-interactive AI analysis system that allows users to:
1. Capture any webpage's DOM content
2. Ask questions about it using voice or text
3. Get AI-powered answers about the page content

## The 4 Core Problems & Solutions

### Problem #1: No DOM Capture Handler ❌
```
Issue:      "Capture Current Page" button didn't work
Root Cause: dom-capture-handler.ts was completely empty
Solution:   Created 150-line handler that:
            ✅ Gets active tab from browser
            ✅ Validates it's HTTP/HTTPS
            ✅ Injects content script to extract DOM
            ✅ Formats and returns extracted content
Result:     Page capture now works end-to-end
```

### Problem #2: Empty Content Script ❌
```
Issue:      No DOM extraction logic in page
Root Cause: /pages/content/src/index.ts had only console.log
Solution:   Implemented 220-line content script that:
            ✅ Extracts main text (cleaned, 12KB max)
            ✅ Extracts heading structure (h1-h6)
            ✅ Extracts links (50 max, relative→absolute URL)
            ✅ Extracts buttons and forms
            ✅ Classifies page type (product, article, social, etc.)
            ✅ Tracks performance metrics
Result:     Rich content extraction from any webpage
```

### Problem #3: Missing AI Analysis Handler ❌
```
Issue:      "Get AI Answer" button returned undefined
Root Cause: multimodal-test-handler.ts was empty
Solution:   Implemented 165-line handler that:
            ✅ Decodes base64 content
            ✅ Sends to HybridAIClient for analysis
            ✅ Returns AI answer with metadata
            ✅ Falls back to test response if AI unavailable
Result:     AI analysis of page content works seamlessly
```

### Problem #4: Unicode Encoding Failed ❌
```
Issue:      "InvalidCharacterError: btoa() Latin1 range"
            Pages with 🎉 ñ é 中文 crashed
Root Cause: btoa() only works with Latin1 (ISO-8859-1)
Solution:   Changed encoding from:
            ❌ btoa(content)
            to:
            ✅ btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(content)))
Result:     Works with ANY character (emojis, accents, CJK)
```

## Architecture at a Glance

```
USER CLICKS "CAPTURE PAGE"
    ↓
PageCaptureTest sends: { type: 'CAPTURE_CURRENT_PAGE' }
    ↓
Background router → handleDOMCaptureMessage()
    ↓
Gets active tab → Injects content script → Extracts DOM
    ↓
Content script calls extractPageContent()
    ↓
Returns: { metadata, content, interactive, performance }
    ↓
PageCaptureTest displays extracted content
    ↓
USER SPEAKS OR TYPES QUESTION
    ↓
PageCaptureTest sends: { type: 'TEST_MULTIMODAL', payload: {...} }
    ↓
Background router → handleTestMultimodal()
    ↓
Decodes content → Calls HybridAIClient.invoke()
    ↓
AI returns answer
    ↓
PageCaptureTest displays AI response
